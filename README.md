## About the project

This little project allows user to create his own account, and later add tasks to his own to-do list. User can enter a title of the task, select a deadline in the future, by which the task should be finished, and mark the task as important, which will change its display on the site. After adding tasks to the list, user can mark it as completed, remove it from the database, or edit it. If the task was created with a deadline value, there is a countdown timer.

The project uses [API repository](https://github.com/sanockipatryk/ReactTodo-API).
